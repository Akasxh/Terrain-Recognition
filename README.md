Project Description
Terrain recognition is essential in various applications, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and environmental monitoring. In this project, we used a CNN to classify images into five terrain categories: grass, sand, water, rock, and forest. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated on a test dataset.

Dataset
We used a custom dataset consisting of images of different terrains. The dataset was divided into a training set and a test set. The training set was used to train the model, while the test set was used to evaluate its performance.

Dataset Statistics:

Total Images: 1000
Training Images: 800
Test Images: 200
Classes: 5 (grass, sand, water, rock, forest)
Model Architecture
The CNN model used for terrain recognition consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layer 1
Max-Pooling Layer 1
Convolutional Layer 2
Max-Pooling Layer 2
Flattening Layer
Fully Connected Layer 1
Output Layer
The model architecture was chosen based on experimentation and fine-tuning. The model was trained using the training dataset and optimized for accuracy.

Results
The trained model achieved an accuracy of 74% on the test dataset, demonstrating its ability to recognize different terrains. Here are some sample predictions:

Grass: 80% accuracy
Sand: 70% accuracy
Water: 85% accuracy
Rock: 65% accuracy
Forest: 78% accuracy
The model's performance can be further improved with additional data and fine-tuning.

Usage
To use the trained model for terrain recognition, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies (see Dependencies).
Load the pre-trained model using a Python script.
Provide an image to the script, and it will predict the terrain type.
For detailed usage instructions, refer to the project's source code and documentation.

TensorFlow (or any other deep learning framework you used)
Jupyter Notebook (for running and experimenting with the code)
Numpy (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
You can install the required Python packages using pip:
