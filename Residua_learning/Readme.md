# ResNet-50 for Terrain Recognition
## Overview
This project implements ResNet-50 for terrain classification, enabling the accurate identification of various terrain types (e.g., forests, deserts, mountains, oceans). Using transfer learning from a pre-trained ResNet-50 model, the system achieves high accuracy in classifying terrain images.

## Model Performance
Validation Accuracy: 88.25%
Test Accuracy: 89.50%
## Model Architecture
ResNet-50 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture with 50 layers that incorporates residual connections, helping mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and enabling deeper architectures to be effectively trained.

## Key Features
Residual Connections: Skips connections over layers to prevent degradation of learning.
Bottleneck Layers: Reduces the number of parameters while maintaining performance.
Depth and Breadth: With 50 layers, ResNet-50 provides a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, making it ideal for image classification tasks.

## Training and Optimization
This project uses transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet-50 model:

Transfer Learning: Pre-trained weights (from ImageNet) are loaded and used for feature extraction.
Fine-tuning: The final layers are unfrozen after initial epochs for fine-tuning on the terrain dataset.
Batch Normalization: Ensure batch normalization layers are in training mode during fine-tuning.

## Dataset
The dataset used for terrain recognition consists of images categorized into different terrain types (e.g., mountains, forests, deserts, oceans). Ensure the dataset is structured properly for training, validation, and testing:

```python

Copy code
/dataset
    /train
        /mountains
        /deserts
        /forests
        /oceans
        /snow
    /val
    /test
```
## Usage
